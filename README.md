# RPhelm--Cataclysm-4.3
 A World of Warcraft Addon for Cataclysm 4.3.4

This is just a fun addon I wrote that automatically hides your helm when you enter an area of rested xp and then turns on helmet display on when you venture out into the world.

NOTE: It doesn't actually remove/unequip your helm, it simply hides it using the interface options toggle.
